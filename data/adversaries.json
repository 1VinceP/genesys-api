         "The feral beasts that terrorize the people of Terrinoth are only pale echoes of the dragons to be found in the Molten Heath. Here, the oldest, wisest, and most powerful dragons make their kingdom, under the guidance of the Dragon Rex. Ancient dragons have all the physical power of their southern kin, matched to an intellect and mastery of magic beyond any mortal. Seldom have the dragons seen fit to meddle in the affairs of mortals, and since the time of the Dragon Wars, these godlike beings have largely passed into legend.",
         "The vast minds of dragons are alien to those of Humans and their kin, and even the Elves can only barely grasp the desires and plots of these ancient wyrms. Scholars still puzzle over the reasons for the Dragon Wars and for the dragons’ abrupt departure. In the vanishingly rare event that a dragon’s activities are known to mortals, they are likely to seem cruel or even senseless. Dragons measure time in spans that mortals can scarcely comprehend; without this context, the lesser races cannot hope to grasp the true cause or goal of a dragon’s action. Compounding matters, dragons have little regard for the lives of Humans or the other peoples of Mennara, with the notable exception of the Elves.",
         "Dragons do sometimes make use of Humans, Orcs, and the other peoples of Mennara in their continued guardianship. More often than not, such individuals never realize they serve the interests of a dragon—particularly in the case of Dwarves, who harbor an abiding hatred for the Dragonkin. Despite the risks of relying on such inferior creatures, throughout history, a number of dragons have seen the mortals of Mennara as potentially useful tools in the battle to protect the Yrthwrights’ creation from the depredations of the Ynfernael and the abyssal entities that dwell within."

         "The most powerful of the Uthuk witches and warlocks are known as bloodsisters and nightseers, respectively. Though not part of the Blood Coven, these immensely skilled sorcerers are the true leaders of the Uthuk tribes. Their influence stretches out across the Ru Darklands, reaching wherever the blades of the Uthuk draw blood. Nightseers in particular are skilled in dreamwalking, a discipline of the original Loth K’har peoples, and have preserved this ancient tradition across the centuries. Adept in battle, gifted with supernatural longevity and resilience, and able to control the minds of those around them, few dare stand against them.",
         "Hierarchy among the bloodsisters and nightseers is based upon the favor of the Ynfernael Lords; these witches and warlocks must constantly prove their right to lead, often through torture and murder. The greatest of their number become the mortal representatives of Ynfernael Lords such as Vel’tar Demonblood or Eurth Kel’yr, the Mistress of Bones, and the interests of their masters often become their own.",
         "While all seek vengeance against Terrinoth and its allies, some bloodsisters and nightseers have their own goals, such as dispatching their rivals or bringing the tribes together under a single leader. The nightseer Quin’tar Shymaex, who dreams of larger things than mere conquest of the Land of Steel, is perhaps one of the most infamous of these. Shymaex seeks to take his place among the Ynfernael Lords himself and transform all Uthuk into true demons, a goal that eluded even Llovar."

Their endless crusade has drained them of any dregs of mercy or compassion, however, as the dark powers they use to fight the Ynfernael slowly poisons their souls.

They draw smoother, fire harder, and break less often than any other bow in the land.",

When they are not serving as guards within the ranks of the Starplain Archers, the Blythwth Arethyl, or the Deepwood Rangers, they seek to participate in bowyer contests, instruct other Elven archers, and locate more impressive game than can be found in the Thalian Glades."

They served as foot soldiers and were discarded after the end of the Dragon Wars, left to fend for themselves in the wilds of Terrinoth.",

Some possess wings, others deadly talons, and still others a hint of the fiery breath so commonly associated with their larger draconic ancestors. Like dragons, they have a hunger for magic in all its forms. As such, hybrids often delve into Terrinoth’s many ruins, or sell their swords to sorcerers and wizards willing to pay their price in magical artifacts. In recent years, they have become more accepted in Dragonkin society, and fight alongside other Dragonkin as inheritors of Margath's legacy."

         "The Dwarven Dragon Hunters are hostile, rage-filled, proselytizing zealots who give every aspect of their lives to the hunt of their ancestral foes. They train endlessly in a specialized style of combat most effectively suited to ending the lives of dragons wherever they can be found, then make pilgrimages to places that report sightings of the beasts. Typically, when Dragon Hunters leave the Dunwarr Mountains, they aggressively try to enlist anyone whom they see as having the makings of an adventurer to join their quest. Refusal results in a barrage of harsh and belittling insults at best, for Dragon Hunters tend to take a dim view of anyone who doesn’t hate dragons as enthusiastically as they do. In some cases, they have even taken their blade to anyone seen as “Dargeth Moni,” or “friend of filth-lizards.”"

There can be little doubt as to the demonic ancestry of these twisted creatures given their blood-red sinew, bulging muscles, and bony, armored hides. As large as fullgrown lions, flesh rippers tower over most prey. Their size, however, belies their speed. Racing across the ground on all fours, these vicious beasts can easily catch a knight on horseback, while soldiers on foot have no hope of outrunning them. When flesh rippers catch their foes, they truly live up to their name; even a single such monster will paint the earth red as it rends apart its prize. Of course, when one sees a single flesh ripper, others are never far behind.",
         "The wrangling of flesh rippers is no easy task, as Uthuk beastmasters’ countless old scars and missing limbs can prove. Witches and warlocks use blood sacrifice to lure the flesh rippers from the tempestuous heart of the Ru and cage them with sorcerous power. The demons are then branded with the N’klashth, or bloodmark, making the covenant of ownership complete. Once the creatures are broken to the will of the Blood Coven, beastmasters use barbed whips to corral them. Then, when the horns of war sound and the beasts are let loose, their instincts takes over, and their masters need only prod them toward the foe and watch the carnage they unleash."

Forest Guardians are preternaturally strong, have the inherent resilience of a dense hardwood tree, and act with an efficient brutality borne of beings who may be utterly divorced from the constraints of traditional mortality. They almost never stride beyond the great forest, however, though some have been seen in large battles against Broken Plains Orc invaders or Uthuk raiding parties."

Lacking any real sense of courage or tactics, goblins usually attack in packs, raiding and stealing what they can before being chased off by the local guard or an angry farmer with a pitchfork. Though it seems they should be easy to exterminate, goblins are quite difficult to completely root out from their caves and homes. Breeding quickly in the dark, they can rebuild their numbers in a matter of months.",

Generally, they tend to rely on their teeth and the claws on their lead fore-legs at the start of combat. Once their prey is wounded and the Gurak feels bold enough to take its eyes off their enemy, though, they swing their massive tails with the force of a trebuchet's ball upon the target's skull or spine. Their tails also allow them to perform a ranged attack when an Orc outrider provides suitable ammunition.",

Covered in glittering diamond scales, each like a huge icy mirror, ice wyrms move across the snow, dazzling enemies just before they strike. Long, icicle-like fangs and wickedly sharp claws make swift work of their victims, while the wyrms’ spines are sharp enough to slice a Human in two.",

Conversant in many dark tongues, these beings have enslaved or bargained with most of the monstrous races of the north, enlisting them in their unending war against the remnants of the Salishwyrd. Many grow great wings of cold leather, and silently glide over the glaciers in search of prey. Some ice wyrms even practice sorcery and are able to spit spells as well as streams of freezing blood. Scarsha the Vile, Queen of the ice wyrms, is perhaps the most deadly of her kind. Heroes who wander into the far north are likely to find themselves drawing her gaze, whether as potential adversaries, prey, or tools in her hunt for the Green Vale."

Their veins filled with sorcerous cold, they become sadistic killers, preying upon any being or creature that crosses their path. Raging and cursing, these frozen beings are drawn to the warmth of hot-blooded creatures so they might quench the heat with their eternal cold. Fighting off such adversaries is a terrible struggle; even their touch can blacken flesh with frostbite.",

While the ice-blood warriors are perils of the north, heroes might seek them out regardless. Like that of ice wyrms and wendigo, their blood has value. Further, rumor has it that there is magic that can bring an individual back from this icy fate, giving hope to those who have lost loved ones to the White Death."

         "Centuries ago, a sorcerer desperately in need of minions used magic to twist a race of beastmen to suit his own depraved purposes. He made them smaller so they could better work in tight spaces, slashed their intelligence so they would never revolt against him, made them genderless so they wouldn’t be distracted by mating instincts, and gave them the ability to reproduce asexually so they would always have large enough numbers for their tasks. He was an exceptionally powerful magician whose intellect was matched only by his lack of foresight.",
         "The kobolds reproduced at an astonishing rate, and they soon overwhelmed the wizard, his stronghold, and the surrounding lands. Luckily, being small and about as bright a particularly dim dog, they tend to fall prey to anything higher up on the food chain (which includes just about everything). Even so, they remain a blight on every corner of Mennara. Occasionally, a kobold may figure out how to construct simple traps, make rudimentary weapons, or even lead a group of their fellows in some semblance of tactics, at which point a pack of kobolds can go from nuisance to menace. They carry out raids on isolated villages or farms, hunting for fresh(ish) meat, shiny baubles, and small domesticated animals.",
         "Packs of kobolds infest the Dunwarr Mountains, and the Dwarves view them as the rest of the world does—annoying, predatory vermin. One of the Rangers' and Warriors' Guilds’ more onerous duties is kobold extermination, which usually falls on the newest members."

Far from unthinking savages, the Free Hunters (as they were called in ancient days) saw their wild nature as a way to better attune themselves with the wild lands around them.",

The mightiest killed only to survive, and the pack went to war only in defense of their own. Over time, songs were sung in Caelcira of lost Latari children rescued from the wild by strange, feral Elves, or even whole villages saved by Elven nomads who could speak the tongues of animals. Nevertheless, some of the most prominent leaders of the Latari noble houses wished to exile these “barbarians” from their sacred forest. Still shunned by the rest of Latari society, the Leonx Riders now keep mostly to themselves and their pack, only making contact with outsiders to offer aid."

         "When the Lords of Bilehall discarded their humanity to join Waiqar, they tied their fates to that of his. They became immensely more powerful as the corrupting mists covered their lands and they rose in undeath. Today, they are an arrogant line, besotted from centuries of indulging in their every desire, exulting in the pleasures of immortality. Each has become a ruler in their own right, and even the lowest vampire of the line of Bilehall can claim a crypt-fortress as their own.",
         "The ages have made the Lords of Bilehall both shrewd and knowledgeable. Some have dedicated themselves to necromancy, even gaining enough power to raise lesser Reanimates. Still others have become masters of warfare and lead raids on the baronies to the south or even into Dunwarr and other realms. It is rare to encounter such creatures without powerful minions to defend them, but such is their hubris that they fear little except Waiqar himself and may step forth alone to toy with those who dare venture into their domains. For an adventurer to survive such an occurrence is even rarer, for Lords such as Kyndrithul and Vorun'thul have had hundreds of years to set traps, arrange countermeasures, and prepare themselves for almost any enemy."

Records indicate not all of the company made it to what would become the city of Lorim, as some gave up on the trek and their new lord. Tavern tales in the Albes speculate these figures may still be questing across Lorimor in search of rights to wrong, hoping one day to one day be allowed to achieve a final rest."

Makhim are seldom encountered alone; they usually travel in great war parties, some scouting ahead, others staying to the shadows. At first glance, their opponents might believe they face but a few of the reptilian creatures, at least until the jungle comes alive with a cacophony of hissing war cries."

Combining the jaws of the shark, the grasping tentacles of the kraken, and the cleverness of the octopus, the god unleashed the merriod into the waters.",

They move with a speed that belies their bulk, their great jaws allow them to bite clean through armor, and their thick hide can ward off the mightiest blows."

The elemental beings thus created may roam as lone predators, but they are just as likely to group together to form entire regions where the laws of nature no longer apply. Either way, they exist to feed upon mortals, whether drinking the water from their flesh, burning their blood for fuel, or devouring the breath from their lungs.",
         "There are many kinds of minor elementals in Al-Kalim. Quicksand elementals lie in wait upon trade routes and near wells to trap the unwary. Some regions are rife with these creatures. In the salt swamps of the Endless Desert, they move across the wastes in the night to surround caravans, whose travelers wake to find themselves lost in a new and deadly landscape. Then, there are flame elementals, which drift on the wind like flickering embers, drawn to the heat of the living. When they find their prey, they burst into blazing life and burn away the flesh of their victims. Spring elementals pose as pools, lakes, or streams of tempting water in the desert wastes, although it is the fluids of their quarry they seek. Should a creature or individual be foolish enough to try to drink from one, the elemental sucks them dry, leaving only a desiccated husk behind."
